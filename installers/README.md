# How to install

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielEFagundes/commita
```

Enter commita's folder and run the command on your bash-based CLI:

```bash
./installers/INSTALLER-<your-operating-system>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of version 1.2.1 of commita, there's only a windows installer, but I'll make one for every OS.

## What's Commita?

Commita is a simple program, which gives you freedom to use easier git commands, they will give you a ready and quick conventional commit message template and even an emoji along with it.

## Commands

Commands that exists on the program:

```bash
git feat        - New feature
git fix         - Bug fix
git chore       - General changes
git docs        - Documentation
git refactor    - Changes that does not affect functionalities

> You can use commita on Windows CLIs, but it's highly not recommended to do that, as some commands need bash to work properly.

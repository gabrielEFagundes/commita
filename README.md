## What's Commita?

Commita will be a simple program, which will give you freedom to use easier git commands, that will give you a ready and quick conventional commit message template and even an emoji along with it.

## Commands

Commands that exists on the program:

```bash
git feat        - New feature
git fix         - Bug fix
git chore       - General changes
git docs        - Documentation
git refactor    - Changes that does not affect functionalities
git remove      - Remove files and directories
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's worth warning that commita's commands do not work properly in powershell/cmd, because those are not based on bash, which means they don't support some specific commands that bash does.
> You can use the commands on the CLIs, but I do not recommend doing that, use git bash instead!

## License
